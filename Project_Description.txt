Write a C or C++ program that will read MIPS-like instructions from a file and output all
the dependences, namely data, name (both anti-dependence and output dependence), and
control dependences. The output file should include the instruction pairs, type of
dependence, and cause of dependence. 

Assume that the instruction set consists of only ALU instructions (ADD, SUB, MUL,
DIV, OR, AND, NOT) and BNE instructions.
