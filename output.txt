Computer Architecture : Project I

Statement:- Write a C or C++ program that will read MIPS-like instructions from a fin and output all the dependences, 
namely data, name (both anti-dependence and output dependence), and control dependences. The output fin should include 
the instruction pairs, type of dependence, and cause of dependence. Assume that the instruction set consists of only 
ALU instructions (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, OR, AND, NOT) and BNE instructions.
